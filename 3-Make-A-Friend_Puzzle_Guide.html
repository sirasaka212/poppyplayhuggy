<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Make A Friend Machine</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the very first chapter of this horror puzzle game, you are introduced to the <strong>Playhuggy Co.</strong> toy factory. You must use<strong>&nbsp;Playhuggy Co.&rsquo;s GrabPack</strong> to solve puzzles and rewire circuits in order to restore power to the factory&rsquo;s many machines. Once you get the red GrabPack hand you must travel down the conveyer belt.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here you&rsquo;ll enter into a room with a large sign reading &ldquo;Make-A-Friend&rdquo; over three large machines. On the exit door of this room, you&rsquo;ll see &ldquo;Nobody leaves without a toy&rdquo; and the door will be locked. You&rsquo;ll see a platform next to this door that will allow you to scan a toy. So, you need to create one using the Make-A-Friend machine and for that, you must power it on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How To Solve?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To power on the machine and make the toy, just follow the steps given below and you&rsquo;ll be done in no time at all.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- Look to the left of the conveyor belt in Poppy Playhuggy&rsquo;s Make-A-Friend room. You will see a staircase leading up to the catwalk above.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- You&rsquo;ll observe that a section of the catwalk is missing. You can pull it out from the other side of the missing section by using the handle with the GrabPack.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- Look to the right of this missing section on a ledge, you&rsquo;ll see a pink VHS tape. What it on the pink VCR at the top of the stairs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- There are 2 fuse boxes, one at the end of the first part of the catwalk and another section that can be pulled out in the middle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- Grab one of the boxes and weave it between the two pillars in the center section. Now power on the second box as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- This will activate the Make-A-Friend machine which will read &ldquo;Power On.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- Once it starts up, the three levers above the conveyor belt will light up. Activate them by pulling them with the GrabPack.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- This will deposit toy parts onto the belt and the belt will transport them through the machine as it assembles a toy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- Collect the finished toy from the end of the belt and place it on the toy scanner to unlock the door.</p>
