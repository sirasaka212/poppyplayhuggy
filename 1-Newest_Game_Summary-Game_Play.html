<p><strong>Chapter 1 &ndash; A Tight Squeeze :</strong></p>
<p>The protagonist receives a package that contains a VHS tape, which shows a commercial for the titular doll poppy play huggy and tours of the factory, before abruptly cutting to spliced in footage of graffiti of a poppy, and a letter from the missing staff, requesting them to "find the flower". They then visit the abandoned toy factory to figure out what happened to the staff. After solving the code to a security door, they watch a VHS tape that introduces them to the GrabPack. After unlocking the door to the lobby with it, they are introduced to wuggy huggy who is on display in the center of the room. While trying to unlock one door in the lobby, the power suddenly cuts, forcing them to restore power in the power room. After heading back to the lobby, they discover that Huggy has disappeared from his display. The protagonist then restores power to a control panel in order to control an overhead crane and retrieve the right hand of the GrabPack. They then unlock and enter the "Make-a-Friend" section of the factory, where they restore power to the machinery and manufacture a toy. They then place the toy in a scanner and open a door to a hallway. After entering the hallway, huggy suddenly appears and chases the protagonist through the vents. After reaching a dead-end, the protagonist pulls down a box and breaks part of the conveyor belt, causing huggy to fall to the bottom of the factory. They then head to the aforementioned poppy graffiti and enter a room, where they find poppy in a case. The protagonist then opens the case, freeing poppy.</p>
